# Youtube Archive Downloader
* I made this tool using **Haxe** and the reason for it is that if you want to download multiple videos and select one then you can store all of those in a singular file named `yad.videos`. \
* Another reason why i made and developed this tool is for the sole purpose of scraping off youtube channel content (specifically channels who have privated their videos but still have an archive of their channel like Composerily). \
* The tool basically crawls through the wayback machine and you can specify the youtube channel links you'd want it to fetch in `yad.channels`. \
There is a specific type of formatting for `yad.videos` and `yad.channels` so please read the usage section of this README document. \
* This tool still probably has bugs and is a little complicated to use.
